	{"text":"I personally believe that this is one of the nicer GE in the area. For some reason the inner-city ones seem dark and dingy. Also, I was at the Waterworks last month and they are renovating this to make it a Market District. If you don't know, now you know ;)","label":1,"text_length":258},
	{"text":"Great company, will go no where else with my heating and air conditioning needs. Came out on New Year's Day, fixed my problem with the heater, and charged me only $70.  It coulda been so much worse. Thanks Legacy!","label":1,"text_length":213},
	{"text":"Why do you punish us with that new pirate show? Yeah, it's a siren song all right, my earwax melted, my drums popped, and I've never prayed for death before... but I did  a little shout out to Jesus about 2.43 seconds into this 'pirate' show.","label":0,"text_length":242},

	{"text":"Since I am a nail tech, I get my shader brushes here.  They have a great selection of quality brushes for a reasonable price.\\n\\nIf you have kids in school that need their canvases this  is a great place to get them, due to the fact you can buy them by the case for less than $20.","label":1,"text_length":280},
	{"text":"the rooms here are really comfortable and the beds are amazing. we only stayed one night but we loved it and will probably be back again. i like the casino here too, so that is an extra plus for sure.","label":1,"text_length":200},
	{"text":"Caution on gas price. This company uses very small print on their low gas price. When you get to the pump is 10 cents higher then what you expect. The print on the gas sign is very small. I would call this deceptive advertising .","label":0,"text_length":229},
	{"text":"FAIL.  Something made my stomach uncomfortable.  My buddy's food didn't look good either.  There are some cute girls that work here but I probably won't be back unless its just for beer.  I went to the bathroom and saw most of the staff at the table playing cards.  I don't think they care much.","label":0,"text_length":295},

	{"text":"FYI Southwest Airlines won't let you print out your borading pass on your return flight until you arrive at the departing airport. Absolutely makes no sense....Will be using another airline for my travels.","label":0,"text_length":205},

	{"text":"Very cool venue for concerts! It's like a having a very big IMAX theater in the back and having a live performer.  The theater makes the experience very real and enjoyable.  The venue is large and seats many people. Perfect for concerts.","label":1,"text_length":237},
	{"text":"ZELDA should be FIRED!  The worst service in the history of service.  I've never been cut off at a coffee bar before after she tried to educate me on the difference between coffee and espresso.  Ummm okay.  Won't be back.","label":0,"text_length":221},
	{"text":"So disappointed.  Didn't know menu is different on weekdays - was so looking forward to eat crab legs.  The buffet choices use to be better - so few things available.   Dessert items are still delicious.","label":0,"text_length":203},
	{"text":"Yeah I get my fried fast food fish fix (5Fs!) here whenever I'm in town and around here.  Living in SF you don't get enough junky fast food and LJS definitely hits the spot - always get tons of tartar sauce - oh yeah!","label":1,"text_length":217},
	{"text":"I eat here for lunch at least three times a week.  Since  have mentioned it to my co-workers, I have half my dealership getting sandw. from this place.  By far the best quality italian sub I've had since Fontano's in Chicago.  Trust me the deli is excellent!","label":1,"text_length":258},

	{"text":"Glad not to have to drive too far out of Scottsdale for authentic Mexican shaved ice treats. The Chamoyada reminds me of a Bloody Mary on ice - salty, spicy and sweet! Perfect way to cool down on a hot day.","label":1,"text_length":206},
	{"text":"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is the beer.  As for the rest, imagine overpaying for not-so-good food in a restaurant that smells like dirty dishwater and looks like it came from chain restaurant heaven.  I guess I just prefer local restaurants over chains.","label":0,"text_length":262},
	{"text":"Great BBQ and sides.  The beans are fantastic, with bits of hot links/sausage. \\n\\nKinda pricey, but most BBQ places are, and this one is worth it.\\n\\nTheir catering is great too.

	{"text":"Fail.  Would have been better to tear it down.  They put some lipstick on it, but it's still old and tired, and the food is just ok at best.    The most laughable part has to be the \\\"\"food court\\\"\" which I would describe as more of a \\\"\"prison cafeteria.\\\"\"","label":0,"text_length":258},
